# 🌍 Global Climate Change Data Analysis (2020–2025)

### Quick Overview
This project explores the **Global Climate Change Data (2020–2025)** dataset from Kaggle.  
It focuses on identifying patterns and changes in **temperature**, **CO₂ emissions**, **sea levels**, and **climate risk index** — giving a concise overview of how the climate evolved during this five-year period.

🔍 **Objectives**
- Analyze year-over-year changes in:
  - Temperature (°C)  
  - CO₂ Emissions (Mt)  
  - Sea Levels (mm)  
  - Climate Risk Index (CRI)
- Determine **which continents contribute most** to global CO₂ emissions.

🧠 **Highlights**
- Cleaned and structured raw data for easier manipulation.  
- Visualized global trends using Python libraries.  
- Revisited key concepts in **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization**.  

🧰 **Tech Stack**
- Python 3.12  
- Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | DataSpell

📈 **Key Takeaway**
Climate metrics show consistent year-over-year increases — especially in **CO₂ emissions** and **sea levels** — reflecting ongoing global warming trends.
